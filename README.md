# Advanced-Multimodal-AI-for-Hate-Speech-and-Misinformation-Detection
An AI project that tackles hate speech and misinformation using a multimodal approach. It combines a BERT-based model for text analysis and a CNN for image feature extraction. The system integrates these components to understand context, demonstrating an ability to solve complex, real-world problems. 

Advanced Multimodal AI for Hate Speech and Misinformation Detection
Project Overview
This project presents a sophisticated solution to a critical social issue: the rapid spread of hate speech and misinformation on social media. Unlike traditional methods that analyze text in isolation, this system takes a multimodal approach, combining the analysis of both text and images to better understand context and identify nuanced forms of harmful content.

The core of this project is a robust AI pipeline that integrates specialized models for different data types. By leveraging state-of-the-art techniques like transformer-based models (BERT) for text and pre-trained CNNs (ResNet/VGG16) for images, the system achieves a higher degree of accuracy in detecting and classifying harmful content.

Problem Statement
The proliferation of hate speech and misinformation is a significant challenge on social media platforms. Existing detection methods often fall short because they fail to account for contextual clues, irony, and visually-based content like memes. This project aims to build a more comprehensive and robust solution by analyzing both textual and visual information simultaneously to make more accurate judgments.

Project Breakdown
1. Data Acquisition
Datasets: This project utilizes publicly available multimodal datasets from platforms like Kaggle or the Hugging Face Hub. The chosen datasets contain pairs of images and associated text captions, or social media posts with both text and image components.

2. Text Analysis
Preprocessing: Raw text is cleaned by removing irrelevant characters, stop words, and special symbols. It is then tokenized for model input.

Feature Engineering: A transformer-based model (e.g., BERT) is used to generate high-dimensional text embeddings. This method captures the semantic meaning and context of the text, providing a richer feature set than traditional methods like TF-IDF.

Classification: A dedicated neural network is trained on these embeddings to classify text as potentially "hate speech" or "safe."

3. Image Analysis
Preprocessing: Images are resized to a uniform size and normalized to prepare them for the CNN.

Feature Engineering: Transfer learning is employed using a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) such as ResNet or VGG16. The final layers are removed, and the model's output is used to extract a fixed-size feature vector (embedding) for each image.

Optical Character Recognition (OCR): An OCR tool is integrated to detect and extract any text present within the images, which is then fed into the text analysis pipeline for a more complete understanding of visual memes or image-based text.

4. Multimodal Fusion
Data Integration: The text embeddings from the BERT model and the image features from the CNN are concatenated into a single, combined feature vector.

Model Training: This concatenated vector is fed into a final classification layer (a small neural network). This combined model is trained to perform the ultimate classification, categorizing the content as "hate speech," "misinformation," or "safe."

5. Deployment
Web Application: A simple, functional web application is built using either Flask or Streamlit to demonstrate the project's capabilities.

User Interface: The application features an intuitive user interface where users can upload an image and enter a text caption.

Real-time Classification: Upon submission, the application processes the text and image through the combined model and displays the real-time classification result.
